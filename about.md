Victor has just completed his undergraduate degree in Oceanography. He likes to let his beard grow almost freely because he thinks it might be useful someday. Victor doesn't know how to swim and has frequent rhinitis crisis. He tends to run away from all sort of hype stuff and loves the <s>beer-burger-fries</s> chocolate-tea-coffee trinity. His research interests mainly reside in numerical modeling, extreme events, ice dynamics, coastal hydrodynamics and sub-mesoscale dynamics.

He has worked for four years as trainee at the Coastal Hydrodynamics Laboratory, located at the Oceanographic Institute, University of SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil, and nowadays he is enrolled in the Masters Programme in Meteorology and Oceanography with study specialization in Physical Oceanography at the University of Bergen, Norway. He works as Research Assistant at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, under the supervision of Prof. Lars Robert Hole. Currently, he integrates the Oil Spill Modelling in Ice Covered Ocean Project (OSMICO), under the MIKON Flagship, which is also his thesis framework.
