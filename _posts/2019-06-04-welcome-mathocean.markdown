**Hello, world! Welcome!**

## What is MathOcean?

MathOcean is a blog created by a tangled-mind Oceanographer for studying purposes. It encompasses three ~~four~~ basic topics:

1. Ordinary Differential Equations
2. Partial Differential Equations
3. Numerical Methods
4. ~~Numerical Modeling~~

The main idea is to present basic concepts of each topic in a simple way, with examples resolution and visual representation using Python.

### Acknowledgments

First of all, I *really* would like to thank Ben Centra for this wonderful project developed by him. You can learn more about Centrarium [here](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

No less important, I would like to thank Prof. Hans Petter Langtangen. His legacy and passion for Science has undoubtedly motivated me to create this blog. You can find some of his [books](http://hplgit.github.io/) and projects that he worked activelly ([DocOnce](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce) and [FEniCS Project](https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/)) on his GitHub [page](https://github.com/hplgit). Moreover, I'm thankful to Prof. Svein Linge and Prof. Leif Rune Hellevik for their huge effort on producing available high quality material to students.
