Hello, world! Welcome!

## What is MathOcean?

MathOcean is a blog created by a tangled-mind Oceanographer for studying purposes. It encompasses three ~~four~~ basic topics:

1. Ordinary Differential Equations
2. Partial Differential Equations
3. Numerical Methods
~~4. Numerical Modeling~~

The main idea is to present basic concepts of each topic in a simple way, with examples resolution and visual representation using Python. Feel free to suggest and contact me!
