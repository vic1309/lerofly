**Hello, world! Welcome!**

We have finally reached the last topic on our journey! Before going deeper and attack it, let's build an intuitive understanding about the problem.

> **- Why should we care about systems of linear ODEs?**

<p align="justify">
  When we consider a linear system of something it means that things are <b>coupled, linked</b>. In other words, if you have two equations with two unknown functions (say $x_1$ and $x_2$) the knowledge of $x_2$ is required to find $x_1$ and the contrary is also true. However, differently from secondary school where we learned how to solve a system of <i>algebraic</i> equations, now we are going to see how to solve a system composed by <i>differential</i> equations. Let's take a look on some examples?
</p>

<p align="justify"> <i><b>Ex. 1:</b></i> <i>Suppose that you have a system which contains two springs with constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ connected by two blocks with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ moving on a surface that creates friction ($b_1$ and $b_2$). Consider that the tip of the first spring is fixed and when no external forces act on them their length are $L_1$ and $L_2$. Finally, consider that the position of the blocks are denoted by $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively (Figure 1).</i> </p>

> *Taking into account those considerations and apllying Newton's Second Law we find that:*

> $$\begin{equation} m_1 \frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} + b_1 \frac{d x_1}{dt} + k_1(x_1 - L_1) - k_2(x_2 - x_1 - L_2) = 0 \tag{1} \label{eq:one} \end{equation}$$

> $$\begin{equation} m_2 \frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} + b_2 \frac{d x_2}{dt} + k_2(x_2 - x_1 - L_2) = 0 \tag{2} \label{eq:two} \end{equation}$$

> Defining parameter values:

* Block masses: \hspace{3cm} $m_1 = 1.0$, $m_2 = 1.5$ 
* Spring constants: $k_1 = 8.0$, $k_2 = 40.0$ 
* Lengths: $L_1 = 0.5$, $L_2 = 1.0$ 
* Friction coefficients: $b_1 = 0.8$, $b_2 = 0.5$

> and initial conditions:

* Initial position: $x_1 = 0.5$, $x_2 = 2.25$
* Initial velocity: $\frac{d x_1}{dt} = y_1 = 0$, $\frac{d x_2}{dt} = y_2 = 0$ 

As you probably have already noticed, we are going to use Linear Algebra in order to solve such problems. For that reason, it's worth to spend a time learning/recapitulating specific points about it. On this first part, I am going to present general ideas about *linear transformation*, *linear independence* and *eigenvalues and eigenvectors*. This knowledge is going to be extremely useful when solving linear systems of ODEs later.

For this first chapter I recommend the following reading/watching list:

## Linear Transformation


Moreover, ODEs are the background of more complex differential equations, such as Partial Differential Equations (PDE), Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) and Delay Differential Equations (DDE).
