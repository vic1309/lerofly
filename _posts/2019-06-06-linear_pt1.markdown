**Hello, world! Welcome!**

We have finally reached the last topic on our journey! Before going deeper and attack it, let's build an intuitive understanding about the problem.

> **- Why should we care about systems of linear ODEs?**

<p align="justify">
  When we consider a linear system of something it means that things are <b>coupled, linked</b>. In other words, if you have two equations with two unknown functions (say $x_1$ and $x_2$) the knowledge of $x_2$ is required to find $x_1$ and the contrary is also true. However, differently from secondary school where we learned how to solve a system of <i>algebraic</i> equations, now we are going to see how to solve a system composed by <i>differential</i> equations. Let's take a look on some examples?
</p>

<p align="justify"> <i><b>Ex. 1:</b></i> <i>Suppose that you have a system which contains two springs with constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ connected by two blocks with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ moving on a surface that creates friction ($b_1$ and $b_2$). Consider that the tip of the first spring is fixed and when no external forces act on them their length are $L_1$ and $L_2$. Finally, consider that the position of the blocks are denoted by $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively (Figure 1).</i> </p>

> *Taking into account those considerations and apllying Newton's Second Law we find that:*

> $$\begin{equation} m_1 \frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} + b_1 \frac{d x_1}{dt} + k_1(x_1 - L_1) - k_2(x_2 - x_1 - L_2) = 0 \tag{1} \label{eq:one} \end{equation}$$

> $$\begin{equation} m_2 \frac{d^2 x_2}{dt^2} + b_2 \frac{d x_2}{dt} + k_2(x_2 - x_1 - L_2) = 0 \tag{2} \label{eq:two} \end{equation}$$

> Defining parameter values:

* Block masses: &ensp; $m_1 = 1.0$, &ensp; $m_2 = 1.5$ 
* Spring constants: &ensp; $k_1 = 8.0$, &ensp; $k_2 = 40.0$ 
* Lengths: &ensp; $L_1 = 0.5$, &ensp; $L_2 = 1.0$ 
* Friction coefficients: &ensp; $b_1 = 0.8$, &ensp; $b_2 = 0.5$

> and initial conditions:

* Initial position: &ensp; $x_1 = 0.5$, &ensp; $x_2 = 2.25$
* Initial velocity: &ensp; $\frac{d x_1}{dt} = y_1 = 0$, &ensp; $\frac{d x_2}{dt} = y_2 = 0$ 

Thus, we are able to transform two second order equations into a system of four first order equations.

As you probably have already noticed, we are going to use Linear Algebra in order to solve such problems. For that reason, it's worth to spend a time learning/recapitulating specific points about it. On this first part, I am going to present general ideas about *linear transformation*, *linear independence* and *eigenvalues and eigenvectors*. This knowledge is going to be extremely useful when solving linear systems of ODEs later.

For this first chapter I recommend the following reading/watching list:

### Linear Independence

Consider the set of nonzero vectors $\mathbf{x_1}$, $\mathbf{x_2}$ and $\mathbf{x_3}$ scaled by three scalars, say *$\alpha_1$*, *$\alpha_2$* and *$\alpha_3$*, respectively. Suppose that we have the following linear combination:  

$$ \alpha_1 \mathbf{x_1} + \alpha_2 \mathbf{x_2} + \alpha_3 \mathbf{x_3} = \mathbf{0} \tag{3} \label{eq:three}$$

The first and trivial solution that arises for Eq. \ref{eq:three} is

$$ \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha_3 = 0 \tag{4} $$ 

For this case, we say that the vectors {${\mathbf{x_1}, \mathbf{x_2}, \mathbf{x_3}, \ldots, \mathbf{x_n}}$} are **linearly independent**. On the other hand, if there is at least one scalar that is different of zero (*e.g* $\alpha_1$ $\neq$ 0), we say that the set is **linearly dependent**. In other words, if it's possible to arrange vectors in a way that one of them is expressed as the linear combination of the others (Eq. \ref{eq:five}), we say the such set of vectors are linearly dependent.

$$ x_1 = -\frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1}x_2 - \frac{\alpha_3}{\alpha_1}x_3 - \frac{\alpha_n}{\alpha_1}x_n \tag{5} \labe{eq:five}$$ 


### Linear Transformation


Moreover, ODEs are the background of more complex differential equations, such as Partial Differential Equations (PDE), Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) and Delay Differential Equations (DDE).
